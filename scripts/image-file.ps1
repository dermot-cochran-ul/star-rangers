# Files generated or downloaded images into src/images/ at the right size and
# name, and stages them on a branch.
#
# LOCAL AUTHORING TOOL - not part of the build, not run by `npm test`, not
# touched by CI. Windows-only, because it drives import-image.ps1, which is
# (System.Drawing/GDI+). Same standing as make-lore-cards.ps1.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: twenty-three lore images meant saving each file, resizing
# it, working out which of src/images/characters/, src/images/lore/,
# .../universes/ or .../planets/ it belonged in, renaming it, and opening a
# PR. scripts/image-prompts.js removes the prompting; this removes everything
# after the image exists.
#
# TWO MODES, PICKED AUTOMATICALLY
#
# MANIFEST MODE - after `image-prompts.js --generate`. Every image is already
# in image-out/ under a key naming its target exactly, so there is nothing to
# pair and nothing to guess. The only choice left is which variation:
# -Pick "<key>=<n>", default 1. This is the mode to prefer.
#
# DOWNLOADS MODE - the clipboard loop, where images arrive in a browser's
# Downloads folder with names that say nothing about what they are. Pairing is
# POSITIONAL: image-prompts.js records the order it served prompts, downloads
# are taken oldest-first, and the two lists are zipped. That holds only as
# long as one image was downloaded per prompt, in the order served.
#
# WHICH IS WHY -WhatIf EXISTS, AND WHY YOU SHOULD USE IT FIRST in downloads
# mode. A re-roll you saved twice, or a prompt you skipped, puts the zip off
# by one FROM THAT POINT ON, and every later image lands under the wrong name.
# -WhatIf prints the whole pairing and changes nothing; -Map overrides any
# pair that is wrong; leftover downloads are reported rather than ignored.
#
# WHAT STAYS MANUAL, ON PURPOSE:
#
#   - Which variation is the keeper.
#   - Writing `image` / `image_alt` into each page's front matter. Alt text
#     describes what the file ACTUALLY SHOWS, which cannot be derived from the
#     prompt that asked for it - see story-bible/images.md, "Alt text is the
#     prompt of record."
#   - Merging. New portraits and lore images are the repo's "draft it and stop"
#     tier: the PR is a proposal.
#
# USAGE
#   .\scripts\image-file.ps1 -WhatIf                    # show what would happen
#   .\scripts\image-file.ps1                            # resize, file, branch
#   .\scripts\image-file.ps1 -Pick "lore-arilon=2"      # manifest mode: variation 2
#   .\scripts\image-file.ps1 -From "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads"   # force downloads mode
#   .\scripts\image-file.ps1 -Map "lore-arilon=abc.png"           # downloads mode: fix a pair
#   .\scripts\image-file.ps1 -NoBranch                  # file into the working tree only
#
# -Since (downloads mode) defaults to the last 24 hours, so an old Downloads
# folder does not get dragged in. Widen it if a session ran long.

Still to do - deliberately, not oversights:

  1. Add ``image`` and ``image_alt`` to each page's front matter. Write the alt
     text from what the file actually shows, not from the prompt.
  2. Commit, push, open the PR as a proposal - new portraits and lore images
     are the "draft it and stop" tier.
  3. CHANGELOG entry under [Unreleased] if these are going out.
  4. Clear the working state once these have landed:
       Remove-Item -Recurse -Force image-out
     (entries with a file in src/images/ read as done anyway)
