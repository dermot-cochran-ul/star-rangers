/**
 * Keeps README.md's "Current version" line in step with package.json.
 *
 * That line has gone stale four times now (it read 1.5.0 through both the
 * 1.6.0 and 1.7.0 releases, and 1.10.0 through 1.11.0, 1.12.0 and 1.13.0),
 * despite the release checklist calling it out as "the step that gets
 * missed". A checklist item that has been missed that often is not a
 * discipline problem, so this replaces the manual step:
 *
 *   node scripts/sync-version.js           rewrite README to match package.json
 *   node scripts/sync-version.js --check   exit non-zero if they disagree
 *
 * The write mode runs automatically from npm's `version` lifecycle hook, so
 * `npm version X.Y.Z` (step 1 of the release checklist) updates the README
 * as a side effect. The check mode runs from `npm test`, so a version edited
 * by hand - bypassing `npm version` entirely - still fails CI rather than
 * shipping a stale line.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a VERSION.md: nothing in the repo reads a version file,
 * and a dedicated one would be a third copy of a number that already lives
 * in package.json and CHANGELOG.md. The fix for a duplicated value is to
 * stop duplicating it by hand, not to add somewhere else for it to drift.
