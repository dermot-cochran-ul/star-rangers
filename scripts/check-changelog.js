/**
 * Asserts that CHANGELOG.md still contains every release it is supposed to.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: released sections have been silently destroyed twice. A
 * branch is cut, `main` gets a release while the branch is open, and the
 * branch's CHANGELOG.md is then written from a stale base - re-emitting the
 * released sections as they stood *before* the release and taking the newest
 * headings with them. `## [1.17.0]` and `## [1.18.0]` both went that way and
 * were only noticed weeks later, because nothing failed. The build passed, the
 * tests passed, the site rendered. A silent loss of history is the worst shape
 * a bug can take, and a paragraph in CLAUDE.md asking people to be careful had
 * already failed at it twice.
 *
 * THE ORACLE IS GIT TAGS, not another copy of the file. Tags are immutable,
 * live outside the working tree, and cannot be clobbered by a bad merge - so
 * `v1.17.0` existing while `## [1.17.0]` does not is decisive evidence, with no
 * base commit to compare against and no guessing.
 *
 * Tags are a SUBSET of releases, deliberately: 1.1.0 through 1.4.0 predate
 * tagging and have headings but no tags. So this checks one direction only -
 * every tag needs a heading. A heading with no tag is fine and always has been.
 *
 * Run from `npm test`, so a branch that loses history fails CI instead of
 * merging quietly.
